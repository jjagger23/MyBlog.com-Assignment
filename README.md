# MyBlog.com-Assignment
This project demonstrates the use of CSS positioning and layout techniques to style a blog-style HTML page using an external stylesheet.

The goal of the assignment was to organize the page using fixed and responsive elements while maintaining a clean and readable layout.

Key Layout Features

A fixed jump menu positioned on the left side of the page that spans the full height of the window

A fixed header at the top of the page containing the site title and navigation buttons

The header is centered within the main content area and does not include the jump menu width

A “Thank you for visiting!” message fixed in the bottom-right corner of the page

Journal articles displayed in fixed-width cards for consistent layout

Responsive reflow of articles when the browser window is resized
